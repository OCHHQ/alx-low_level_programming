# School Project

This project demonstrates a simple Makefile for compiling a C program.

## Compiling and Running

To compile and run the project, simply run the command `make -f 0-Makefile` in the project directory. This will build the `school` executable, which you can then run with the command `./school`.

## Makefile

The Makefile (0-Makefile) is located in the project directory and contains the rules for compiling the `school.c` source file into the `school` executable.
